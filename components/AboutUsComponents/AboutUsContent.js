              FICAC was established in Copenhagen in October 1982. It was born
              of the necessity to bring together Consular Associations or Corps
              from all over the world and to share experience, and co-ordinate
              efforts to enhance the status and effectiveness of the Consul, the
              oldest institution serving International bilateral relations.
